![TWNWAKing's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=TWNWAKing&count_private=false&show_icons=true&theme=monokai)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CTF challenges, especially pwn (binary exploitation). 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web dev, C dev, CTF things, ML, competitive algo contests and a lot of stuff. I'm still a newbie in computer science now so I'm trying to learn as wide as I can.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My nickname TWNWAKing comes from the Wrong Answer King of competitive programming in TaiWaN. TWN + WA + King.
- ðŸ˜„ I'm still cleaning up most of my repos, I'll make them public when they're tidied.
